## ZOO -> Ronnie Stevens
Freelance webdeveloper, Plone expert, and Python developer also working
with Django and Wagtail. While focusing on usability, the user-experience
is leading in the projects I run.

## Why ZOO
I work together with my clients to come to an optimal solution.
Professional, transparent and informal is what best describes my way of
working and cooperating.

## Django / Wagtail
I am a Plone-specialist, working with Plone more than 10 years. I have build dozens websites with Plone, from small to midsized, and cooperated on major Plone-sites. I have a lot expertise in running, maintaining and supporting existing Plone websites.

## Ruby / Jekyll
Jekyll is a so called Flatfile based site generator based on Ruby-on-Rails. This extremely
lightweight system is very usefull for blog-solutions or ultra-fast static
websites

## Responsive design
A website in 2016 needs to be responsive. I work with Bootstrap, JQuery,
Less and Sass to make sure the user-experience is optimized on every device.

## Powerful and extremely user-friendly.
Plone has a track-record as a very secure, powerful and user-friendly
platform to develop websites and intranets, both for small companies as
major organisations. There are dozens of governmental and non-profit
organisations that are using Plone.

## Consultant
Major projects often lack good communication. The gap between technical
developers and communication-departments often lead to failures that
easily can be avoided. I am able to talk to both developers and
communication officers, creating a mutual understanding of the business
needs and translating these to solutions that can technically be realised.
